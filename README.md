# InstantParty

## Product Vision

For solo performers, party havers, or anyone looking for a space to rent out (ranging from a small venue to a large lot), **InstantParty** is an online marketplace that connects customers with space lenders. It provides a seamless and secure platform to book or list properties. Unlike Airbnb, our product is highly automated and values customer feedback.
