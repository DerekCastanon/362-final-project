      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>Last updated: April 23, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to InstantParty! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern
        your use of our website, mobile application, and platform (collectively,
        the "Service") operated by InstantParty Inc. ("we", "us", or "our").
      </p>

      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using InstantParty, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        InstantParty is an online marketplace that connects individuals or
        groups (the "Renters") looking for party spaces with property owners
        (the "Lenders") offering spaces for short-term rental. Our platform
        supports automated booking, secure transactions, and feedback-driven
        improvements.
      </p>

      <h2>User Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding
        contract to use InstantParty. You may not use the Service if you have
        been previously banned by us.
      </p>

      <h2>User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        To list a space, you must create an account and provide accurate,
        complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the
        confidentiality of your account credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>Listings and Bookings</h2>
      <p>
        Lenders are responsible for accurately describing the property,
        availability, and pricing. Renters must review all details before
        booking. InstantParty is not a party to any agreement between Lenders
        and Renters.
      </p>

      <h2>Payments and Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Payments are processed securely through our platform. InstantParty
        charges a service fee which is disclosed at the time of booking or
        listing. All transactions are final unless otherwise stated in our
        cancellation policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Cancellation policies vary by listing. It is the Renterâ€™s responsibility
        to review the policy before booking. Disputes will be handled through
        our support team and resolved based on platform policies and evidence
        provided.
      </p>

      <h2>Conduct and Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Users must behave respectfully and lawfully. Any damage, illegal
        activity, or disruptive behavior may result in removal from the platform
        and liability for damages. Lenders are responsible for ensuring their
        property meets safety standards.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback and Automation</h2>
      <p>
        We value user feedback to improve our platform. InstantParty may use
        automated systems to match Renters with suitable spaces, prioritize
        high-rated listings, and enhance the user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        InstantParty is not responsible for any direct or indirect damages
        resulting from interactions between users or issues with listed
        properties. We do not guarantee the accuracy of listings or the conduct
        of users.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be effective upon
        posting. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes
        acceptance.
      </p>
